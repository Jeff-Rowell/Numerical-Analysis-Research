# Numerical-Analysis-Research
This project analyzed classical, non-derivative numerical integration schemes such as the Trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules against derivative based numerical integration schemes. The Hermite numerical integration schemes are designed to exceed the classical rules by reducing the number of computations required, while improving accuracy and efficiency. This research focuses on utilizing Hermite polynomials to derive two numerical integration strategies rather than using Lagrange polynomials where the Trapezoidal and Simpson’s methods originate. Our main difference is to include derivative information, or approximations to the derivative in our numerical integration rules --- these approximations of the derivatives will use a finite difference scheme. We showed that these derivative based methods are far superior to the classical methods of numerical integration.
